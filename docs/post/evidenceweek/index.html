<h1 id="evidencweek">#Evidencweek</h1>

<p><a href="http://senseaboutscience.org/">Sense About Science</a> is a charity that promotes proper use of science and evidence in the public sphere. As stated on its website, it looks to intervene to hold &ldquo;those responsible to account&rdquo;. One of their latest ventures is called Evidence Week. The premise of the event is to bring together Members of Parliament with community members and other interested parties to discuss the need and use of evidence in policy-making.</p>

<p>The first edition of this event took place last week, and I was fortunate enough to be able to volunteer and assist with this great organisation. You can find a detailed program <a href="http://senseaboutscience.org/activities/evidence-week-programme/">here</a>. One of the main interventions Evidence Week proposed was a stand outside of one of Westminster&rsquo;s main halls so passersby could engage with the volunteers and talk about evidence for a few minutes. Originally intended to catch the attention of MPs, it also allowed us to interact with the staff of the building, visitors, and unsuspecting tourists.</p>

<p>Evidence is important for what we all do - here are a few thoughts after attending the event last week.</p>

<p>There is a clear trade-off between how much information one can gather, and how quickly one can act. Think about buying a vacuum cleaner for your house. Any vacuum cleaner will clean your house, but: Can it clean all the corners in your house? Do you have carpets? Does it use bags or a container? Is it (very) loud? Do you have space to store it? How much does it cost? Can you buy it? Your friend suggested one based on their own experience, but, can their vacuum cleaner clean your house? I could go on forever, and if I try to answer all of those questions, I would never buy a vacuum cleaner, defeating the purpose of the entire exercise. But the first step to make a decision on which vacuum cleaner to buy is to understand what you need to do with it.</p>

<p>In this regard, #evidenceweek&rsquo;s briefing materials point to several resources policy makers can make use of. One of the most interesting ones is a European Research Council funded project, <a href="http://bit.ly/GoodEvidence">Getting Research into Policy in Public Health</a>. The post gives advice to researchers, suggesting that it is important to produce evidence that  &ldquo;demonstrates the effectiveness of a particular action, but also why it is appropriate to the specific policy questions being asked.&rdquo; In other words, make sure that what you are providing evidence on is relevant to the people who are asking the questions. <a href="https://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org/publication/using-research-evidence-a-practice-guide-january-2016/">Another report</a> provides a guide on how to use evidence for proper research.</p>

<p>Back to the vacuum cleaner, it is not clear how much evidence is needed, but also not really clear how much evidence is being supplied. A <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/evidence%20and%20evaluation%20in%20template_final_0.pdf">report</a> by the Institute for Government on evidence for policymaking indicates that there are problems on both sides of the equation, but the focus is on how is evidence asked for by politicians and public servants and how is it used; there does not seem to be a culture of using rigorous evidence amongst civil servants. This report (whose representativity I wonder about) was published in 2012, and several others have been published since. But, are they being read by the people who need to read them?</p>

<p>I am sure people have wondered if we need more evidence to keep on moving forward, or if we need to buy the vacuum cleaner and start cleaning before dust takes over. I do not think evidence needs to become a research field on its own, we will probably get nowhere if it does. But we need to make sure that the people that make decisions ask themselves these questions and think critically about how they are doing their job.</p>

<p>Initiatives like the one by Sense About Science are certainly needed, and more people should know about what they are doing and, if possible, volunteer. The next question is, what kind of effect do they have? I will look into this in a later post. Stay tuned.</p>
